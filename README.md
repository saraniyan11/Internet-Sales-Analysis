# Internet-Sales-Analysis

This project focuses on transforming a business request into actionable insights for creating a sales dashboard. The task begins with analyzing a request from a sales manager to improve internet sales reporting by transitioning from static reports to interactive Power BI dashboards. 

Key objectives include visualizing sales data by product, customer, and time; enabling filters for sales representatives; and incorporating budget data from Excel to track performance against targets. The process involves creating a Business Demand Overview to document the request's value, necessary systems, and other details, followed by drafting User Stories to define user needs and acceptance criteria. These inputs guide data cleansing, transformation, and dashboard creation to meet stakeholder requirements.
